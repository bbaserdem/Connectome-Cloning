\frametitle{Remarks}
\begin{itemize}
        \item SA is a viable tool to generate connectome locally from a netlist
            representation. Convergence is guaranteed.
        \item Convergence time of such an algorithm is polynomial on network
            size and density.
        \item Low level connectivity information can be encoded and recovered
            from DNA sequences in a biologically plausable way.
    \end{itemize}
